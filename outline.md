For today's assignment, I've chosen to work on my logic writing skills. After reviewing the objectives for today, I think the best way for me to work on this weakness is create and test practice logic in javascript (also, my weakest language). The idea of this exercise is to prepare for interview questions as well as just feeling more confident overall in my ability to solve basic problems independently.

My outline for today is as follows:
1) Research common questions used in technical interviews
2) Create a webpage with those problems, similar to a quiz.
3) Write the logic on the backend to solve them
4) Check answers by running tests
5) Create frontend to webpage to submit answers
6) Program responds to whether or not given answer is correct


Update:
As the day wraps up, I wanted to update my timeline of work. Initially, I attempted to write tests for my solutions to the problems on my quiz. However, that proved to be challenging. I was able to write the functions and test some using node in the terminal. I also provided a walk through in the code itself to demonstrate understanding of functionality. Some tests worked, and others still have compiling errors. I realize testing is important and it does help me to understand how things work by breaking them down. I think that I did get decent practice in solving basic code problems that I'll likely encounter again. All of that said, I'm going to spend the remainder of the day attempting to solve the testing problems I've encountered.

Final Update:
The compiling error in the tests was a simple syntax error. All tests are now passing. Since that is now solved, the functions and tests are all complete. I'm going to spend the remainder of my time working on the html and possibly some interface functionality.
